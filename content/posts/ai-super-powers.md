## AI Super-powers China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order. By Kai-Fu Lee

I stumbled across Kai-Fu Lee on the on the [Lex Fridman AI Podcast](https://lexfridman.com/ai/), as an aside, this podcast is brilliant and I highly recommend it. The [Kai-Fu Lee episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ48rP_Rs4g&list=PLrAXtmErZgOdP_8GztsuKi9nrraNbKKp4) really made me think about societal structure and the role of education. Both the host, Lex Fridman and Kai-Fu both had a deep and humble conversation and they impressed me very much. Kai-Fu's [book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/AI-Superpowers-China-Silicon-Valley/dp/132854639X) was then a very obvious next step!

The book was pretty fascinating, what struck me was that in China, there appears to be a deep understanding that the government should build infrastructure and provide the raw ingredients for success. They invest in education, in physical infrastructure, and then build an environment, which through intense competition, provides opportunity and a proving ground for serial entrepreneurs, engineers and developers.

On the AI front this then leads to a trove of data which is unprecedented. With very little concern about privacy. Although the government are stepping in in bringing in regulation regarding individuals privacy protection.

The investment in STEM makes me long for a similar vision for us in the UK. That we have ready access to education, training and opportunities for even the most vulnerable parts of society. As opposed to the underfunding of our institutions, the greed and the rampant cruelty we have had for the past 40 years.

The book is highly recommended, it will make you think.
