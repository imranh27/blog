[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/0144391c-9b53-4411-bdb8-170afb9a29dc/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/imranh27-blog/deploys)

The following repository is for my personal [blog](https://imranh27-blog.netlify.app), built using [hugo](https://gohugo.io) and it is deployed to Netlify.

The site uses the theme [hermit](https://themes.gohugo.io/hermit/)

To build the site locally before deploying, make sure your pages are not drafts and just call:

```shell script
$ hugo
```
then add the files and commit to Github.
