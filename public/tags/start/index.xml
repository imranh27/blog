      <description>First post &amp;ldquo;Thinking is nothing but talking to yourself on the inside&amp;rdquo; Richard Feynman.
Hello, so this is a the beginning of my blog and taking that classic quote to heart, I guess this is a way for me to talk to myself a bit clearer and in a bit more organised manner.
The posts will range across a range of topics, from books I am or have read, to software development or just anything that my brain seems to find interesting.</description>
