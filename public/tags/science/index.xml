      <description>AI Super-powers China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order. By Kai-Fu Lee I stumbled across Kai-Fu Lee on the on the Lex Fridman AI Podcast, as an aside, this podcast is brilliant and I highly recommend it. The Kai-Fu Lee episode really made me think about societal structure and the role of education. Both the host, Lex Fridman and Kai-Fu both had a deep and humble conversation and they impressed me very much.</description>
