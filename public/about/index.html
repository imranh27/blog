		<div class="content">
			<p>So, who am I? Well, I am currently a BI and Integration Developer living in York, UK. I have spent most of my career up to my elbows in SQL. But I have been gravitating towards developing structure in code.</p>
<p>From when I was little, the things I loved.. Structured drawing, technical drawing, engineering of all kinds. I am a sucker for an exploded diagram!</p>
<p>I loved Physics and Chemistry when I was growing up. A little later I discovered Maths and I fell in love with that too.</p>
<p>The past few years I have discovered that code can be the lego block which allows me to build systems which solve problems. So I have been exploring various languages, I am inspired by people building cool stuff and find myself gravitating towards F# and Haskell and other interesting toolsets. I guess I am looking for a way to build cool stuff too and inspire myself in the process.</p>
<p>Things I also love, running, climbing, cross country skiing, playing the piano and reading. I loved reading when I was growing up, I have lost the habit but I am picking it up again, so I will be reporting back on the books I have been reading too.</p>
<p>I guess I am a life long learner who will be using this to report back my findings!</p>
